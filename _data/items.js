Anything acting on the results the field filters (group by, sort, density, saved view) is a different object and by default moves outside as a sibling button in the same toolbar row, per Filter, sort, faceted search — where it can carry a visible label and its current setting instead of hiding behind an icon. Rail exception: where the field spans a narrow panel with no toolbar row to move into (the Designer asset palette and other inverse rails), one view control may share the slot if it acts on the list below, is icon-only at 16px in the magnifier's subtle grey with no button chrome, is the only one (clear + one is the ceiling), and is a real `<button>` with `aria-label` plus `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded` when it opens a menu.
